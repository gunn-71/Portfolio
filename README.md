# Portfolio

This Angular-based project is a responsive portfolio website that leverages Angular's routing mechanism for seamless navigation across its five core components: Navbar, Footer, Home, About, and Contact. The user interface is enhanced using Angular Material's `mat-card` to present content in a modern and visually appealing manner. Explore the live demo and contribute or provide feedback through the GitHub repository.
